I'm a recent graduate of [The University of Chicago](uchicago.edu), where I studied Computer Science and Mathematics.

Currently, I work at [D.E. Shaw & Co.](deshaw.com) as a Software Engineer. I spent my first 3 years productionizing [Turnstile](https://saltmarch.com/watch/turnstile-a-hierarchical-authorization-system).
