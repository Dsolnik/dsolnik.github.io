I'm a current masters student in Statistics at [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu).

I'm a recent Computer Science and Mathematics graduate of [The University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu).

Currently, I work at [D.E. Shaw & Co.](https://deshaw.com) as a Software Engineer. In my first 3 years, I created and
productionized [Turnstile](https://saltmarch.com/watch/turnstile-a-hierarchical-authorization-system), the authorization
system of the firm. 

I've also worked on encrypted, high performance sockets and at-rest container encryption in the OCI ecosystem.
