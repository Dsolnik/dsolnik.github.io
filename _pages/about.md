I'm a Statistics master's graduate from [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu) and a Computer Science and 
Mathematics graduate of [The University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu).

Currently, I work at [D.E. Shaw & Co.](https://deshaw.com) on alternative data. In my first 3 years, I created and
productionized [Turnstile](https://saltmarch.com/watch/turnstile-a-hierarchical-authorization-system), the authorization
system of the firm. 

I've also worked on encrypted, high performance sockets and at-rest container encryption in the OCI ecosystem.
